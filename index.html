        <p>My name is Benjamin Harden, I am an undergraduate student studying computer programming. I highly enjoy programming but I have little to no experience. I have worked on very few projects, but I have a job as a junior programmer and I have been tasked to learn their website and begin managing certain parts of it. it is very overwhelming Some other projects I have worked on include, my current project with my digital ocean website and the programming labs I did in CS 142 and I helped my friend with a app that flies drones although he did most of the coding and I did the theory and math</p>
